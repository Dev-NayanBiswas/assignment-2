## Assignment-2
**short-overview**
_Here is a short description of my website.
I styled my elements based on a few custom variables and CSS usual properties,
like..._


- I used **[clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp "Read more about css clamp")** method to get the fluid typography on every screen,

- Linear-gradient, 
- rgba, rgb colors, 
- Transition for a smooth effect on hover, 
- CSS Animation,
- flex and grid. 
- In the mobile view menu bar is accessible as a drop-down bar but not functional,
- On **training and exercises** part I applied pseudo-elements and mix-blend-mode with a slider effect on hover,
- Finally it's responsive on both large mobile(425px) and tablet(992px) devices as well

## for Bonus
I added **FAQ section**, its dumbbells are hover animated and the question bars have box shadows to get an embedded look,

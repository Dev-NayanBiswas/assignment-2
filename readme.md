## Assignment-2
**short-overview**
_Here is a short description of my website.
I styled my elements based on few custom variable and css usual properties,
like..._


- I used **[clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp "Read more about css clamp")** method to get the fluid typography on every screen,

- linear-gradient, 
- rgba, rgb colors, 
- transition for a smooth effects on hover, 
- animation,
- flex and grid. 
- In mobile view menu bar is accessible as drop down bar but not functional,
- on **training and exercises** part I applied pseudo elements and mix-blend-mode with a slider effect on hover,

## for Bonus
I added **FAQ section**, its dumbbells are hover animated and question bars has box-shadows to get an embedded look,

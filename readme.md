Here is a short description of my website.
I styled my elements based on few custom variable and css usual properties,
like...

=> clamp() method and rem, to get the fluid typography on every screen, 
=> linear-gradient, 
=> rgba, rgb colors, 
=> transition, 
=> animation,
=> few flex and grid properties. 
=> In mobile view menu bar is accessible as drop down bar but not functional,
=> added a FAQ section as bonus part and its dumbbells are hover animated and added box-shadows to get an embedded look,
=> on training and exercises part I applied pseudo elements and mix-blend-mode with a slider effect on hover,
